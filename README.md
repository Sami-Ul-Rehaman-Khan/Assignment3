#Task1
This Python program calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion the below description tells how it works:
Function Definition (factorial):
The program defines a function named factorial that takes one argument c.
It checks if c is less than 2 (i.e., 0 or 1). If so, it returns 1 because the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1 by definition.
Otherwise, it returns c multiplied by the factorial of (c - 1). This is a recursive call, where the function keeps calling itself with a decremented value until it reaches the base case (c < 2).
Taking User Input:
The program asks the user to enter a number (n).
The input is converted to an integer using int(input()).
Displaying the Result:
It prints the factorial result using the print function by calling the factorial function with the input number n.

#Task2
The firt line **" from math import * "** line imports all functions from Pythonâ€™s built-in math module.
It allows you to use functions like **sqrt(), log(), and sin()** directly without prefixing them with math. every time.
This program demonstrates how to use common mathematical functions (sqrt, log, sin) from the math module.
It shows input handling, type conversion, and simple mathematical operations.
